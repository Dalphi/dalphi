Dalphi - Active Learning Platform for Human Interaction

## Getting started

Dalphi requires Ruby 2.3.0 to work properly.
With `rvm` it can be installed by running the following.

```bash
rvm install ruby-2.3.0
rvm use ruby-2.3.0
```

Get Dalphi by cloning the official repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/implisense/dalphi.git
```

In the cloned repo run the `bundler` in order to install all dependencies.

```bash
cd dalphi
gem install bundle
bundle install
```

Start the application with `foreman`, so that every component is started correctly.

```bash
foreman start
```
